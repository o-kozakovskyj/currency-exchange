# currency-exchange
Currency-exchange[DEMO](https://exchange-window.netlify.app/)
## Using this App You Can Calculate The Exchange Rate Of main world currencies
!!!Important Note: I used free API for this app, so the exchange rate is not real time, it's updated every 24 hours!!!
!!!Important Note: Free API has a limit of 500 requests per month & restrics requests per second, so if you get an error, it means that you have exceeded the limit. That why can be some bags during validation max amount to change & loading rates!!!
